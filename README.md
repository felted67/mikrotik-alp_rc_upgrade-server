# **Information & Theory**

## mikrotik-alp_rc_upgrade-server  - Docker-image for Mikrotik®-devices

This docker-image for Mikrotik®-devices is intended to install inside a container-enabled device.<br />
If your Mikrotik®-device is able to run docker-images mainly depends on the device and the used RouterOS (ROS®).<br />
Versions beginning from 7.5 (roughly) are able to run containers on the device. The current version this image is build for <br />
is RouterOS 7.10 (at the time this documentation is written). Also container-functionality is current only available for AMD64-,<br />
ARM64- and ARM-architectures/devices.<br /> 
<br />
First you need to enable the container-feature on your device. Please use the Mikrotik®-documentation for enabling the container-mode.<br />
The documentation can be found here: https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ROS/Container
<br />
Also some preliminaries should be kept in mind. First be sure that the system is powerful enough to run a docker-container.<br />
This means that your device must have enough available RAM and disk space (external storage), and also a powerful CPU.<br />
Currently the following CPU-architectures are available for docker-container: ARM, ARM64 and X86_64(AMD64).<br />
For external storage there is the paket "rose-storage" available, this can be used to mount SMB, NFS and iSCSI-devices into<br /> 
the Mikrotik®-device. Please keep in mind, that NFS-shares may lack of not allowing "chmod"- and "chown"-commands<br />
on the shares. Also you could use a external-disk (SSD/USB-Stick) as a storage-device.<br />
<br />
This image is build using Docker-in-Docker-techniques on a CI/CD-system. The images are tested on several CHR-<br /> 
(CloudHostedRouter)-systems on  AMD64(x86_64)-hosts (virtual/non-virtual) and also on different<br /> ARM/ARM64-devices (hAP ax2, hAP ax3, RB3011 and others).<br />

### Theory of the image   

Mainly a docker-image consists of one process, which is running alone in the container on the host-system. This means when this<br /> 
process has ended, the whole container ends. At this point this image is different. Because of using a very small Linux (Alpine Linux),<br />
it is possible to run the openrc-init-system in the container as the main process. This openrc-process breaks the historical way a<br /> 
container is meant to run, but gives also to control running tasks inside the container.<br /> 
So mainly the openrc-(init) -process is running all the time, giving the chance to add several more tasks to the container. <br />
Also it is possible to restart the processes beside openrc running inside the container without killing the complete container itself.<br />
This is the main theory of this image - no magic for far...<br />

### Installation of docker-image

First open WinBox® and connect to the device.<br />
Install docker-image to Mikrotik®-device and attach via "New Terminal" and  <code>/container shell number=X </code> (where X is the number of container).<br />
There are three arch-versions available: <br />
amd64 => for chr-devices (x86_64)<br />
arm64 => for arm64/aarch64-devices<br />
arm => for arm-devices<br />
If you don't now the number of the container, please type on the console in WInBox®:<br />
<code> /container print</code> - The number of the container is given on the output.<br />
In the previous opened shell of the container in terminal of WinBox® do:<br />
1.) Set root-password: $ <code>passwd root </code><br />
2.) Run <code>/sbin/first_start.sh</code> to complete configuration of the image.<br />
3.) Assign under IP/Firewall/NAT a DST-NAT-rule to ip of docker-container (defined under /interfaces/veth) and needed port of service in container. <br />

### Remarks

The tag beside -devel and -latest displays the version of the image, devided in two parts with a "-" between them.<br /> 
Left part of image-tag reflects the used AlpineLinux-version (v3.18.2-..).The right part is the version of the image itself (..-0.0.1).<br />
Tag -latest is the actual and latest (highest tag) stable running version.<br />
Tag -devel is the current development version, not advised for production. Also the -devel-tag may not run, as development in going on.<br />
***Please be advised again NOT to use the -devel-version in a production-environment.***<br /> 
Because of development is made with Gitlab and therefore with CI/CD-techniques, these version are created automatically without further notice<br /> 
and will not be revised or tested permanently. A tagged version with version-number or the -latest-tagged-images are tested on the target-system <br />
before getting tagged !<br /> 
</p>
It is useful at the beginning to assign the container a root-directory (Root-Dir) to get a "stable" filesystem for the container.<br />
Using rose-storage-package for filesystem of container may not work if nfs-shares are used.
Depending on the service and/or first_start.sh-script<br /> a chown or chmod in the script may not work on nfs-shares.<br />
